\title{Notes on Homeostasis and Plasticity in a Non-binary Recurrent Network}
\begin{document}
\section{Equations of the Network Model}
We investigate a discrete-time, fully connected recurrent network model that includes homeostatic threshold and gain control by using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a target distribution and neuronal output as a control measure. Standard parameters of the model are given in Table \ref{tab:parameters}. Find the details of the model in the following sections.
\begin{table}

\caption{Parameters of the network}

\begin{tabular}{l|r}
$N$ & $300$ \\
$\mathrm{E}[W]$ &  $0$\\
$\mathrm{Std}[W]$ & $1/\sqrt{N_e}$ \\
$\mu_b$ & $0.001$ \\
$\mu_a$ & $0.001$ \\
Initial $a$ & $1$ \\
Initial $b$ & $0$
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:parameters}
\end{table}

\subsection{Neuron Model}
At discrete times $t$, each neuron $i$ in our network is characterized by a single activity variable $y^t_i$. The next state is calculated by:
\begin{align}
y^{t+1}_i &= \sigma\left(x^t_i\right) \\
\sigma(x) &= \frac{1}{1+\exp(-a(x-b))} \\
x^t_i &= x^t_{i,ee} + x^t_{i,eext} = \sum_j W_{ij} y^t_j  + x^t_{i,eext} \\
\end{align}

where $W_{ij}$ is a connectivity matrix whose properties are described in the following section and $x^t_{i,eext}$ is an optional external input.

\subsection{Recurrent Network Properties}
$W_{ij}$ is a fixed randomly generated matrix, whose entries were drawn from a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation given in Table \ref{tab:parameters}. Autapses were prohibited, meaning that $W_{ii} = 0$. Note that we did not impose Dale's law onto the sign of our connections.
