How can a dynamical system $x(t)$ be modified appropriately, such that it can generate an output signal $y(t)$ that mimics or predicts some target signal $f(t)$?

In fact, different task scenarios have to be distinguished:

How can a dynamical system $x(t)$ be modified appropriately, such that it can generate an output signal $y(t)$ that mimics or predicts some target signal $f(t)$?

In fact, different task scenarios have to be distinguished:

\bigskip
In one scenario, the system is supposed to predict the \emph{future} state of the $f(t)$ based on the history of $f(t)$.

This task usually involves feeding the target signal into the dynamical system, even after learning, since an accurate prediction requires the integration of information about the past.

In this case, the role of the dynamical system can be regarded as a computational, or information processing unit.

How can a dynamical system $x(t)$ be modified appropriately, such that it can generate an output signal $y(t)$ that mimics or predicts some target signal $f(t)$?

In fact, different task scenarios have to be distinguished:

\bigskip
In another case, the dynamical system is supposed to autonomously generate an output $y(t)$ that reproduces $f(t)$.

Here, $x(t)$ does not receive $f(t)$ as an input, since this would turn the task into a trivial problem, solved by simply passing on $f(t)$ to $y(t)$.

In contrast to the first case, the process of learning can be rather interpreted as solely building an internal model of the dynamics underlying $f(t)$.

Still, also the first tasks requires the system to build some internal representation of the underlying structure of the signal it receives.

In a living organism, the need to autonomously generate patterns of output might seem more ``obvious", e.g. with respect to motor control. However, being able to predict sensory signals is also crucial for taking appropriate actions under a changing environment.
